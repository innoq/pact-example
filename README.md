# Pact Example

**[Pact](https://docs.pact.io) examples for the JVM using [Pact JVM](https://github.com/DiUS/pact-jvm)**

These examples were written for my german
[JavaSPEKTRUM](http://www.javaspektrum.de/) article [Der Praktiker: Pacta sunt servanda -
Consumer-Driven Contracts â€“ Testen von Schnittstellen innerhalb einer
Microservices-Architektur](http://www.sigs-datacom.de/fachzeitschriften/javaspektrum/archiv/artikelansicht/artikel-titel/der-praktiker-pacta-sunt-servanda-consumer-driven-contracts-testen-von-schnittstellen-innerha.html).

You can read it online [here](https://www.innoq.com/de/articles/2016/09/consumer-driven-contracts/)
or download as PDF [here](http://www.sigs-datacom.de/uploads/tx_dmjournals/vitz_JS_04_16_TaTZ.pdf).

## Run the Example

* Run `mvn integration-test` in the `consumer` subdirectory.
* Note that JSON Pact files were created in `consumer/target/PACTS`
* Run `mvn integration-test` in the `provider` subdirecty.
* Note that this test uses the JSON Pact files in `pact-example/provider/src/test/resources/pacts`.

So to change the contract the consumer team would change the tests in `consumer/src/test`. This would result in different Pact files. The consumer team would provide them to the provider team. That way the Pact file would be integrated in the `provider` project. The provider team needs to assure that the tests pass.
